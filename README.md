# Anna-Lang
AI assisted programming language for easy, flexible programming with multiple execution modes for performance and fuzzyness.
  
## Concepts
Anna aims to integrate traditional programming with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).  
Beyond AI code generation compatability, Anna will provide multiple execution modes:
- static: for deterministic code generation, executed/compiled by Anna and external runtimes.
- AI active: LLM in-the-loop for reasoning & decision making, agent instructions are part of program logic flow.
- hybrid: pre-compiled code is main logic, Active LLM handles edge cases and fuzzyness.
  
Anna will be easy to use for humans and allow AI to generate & **evaluate** code effectively using a reasonably-sized LLM, with a compiler/runtime capable of executing AI-generated Anna code in both traditional "static" fashion and by an AI Agent.
